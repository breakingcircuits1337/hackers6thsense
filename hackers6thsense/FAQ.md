# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Q: Do I need all three AI providers?
**A:** No! You only need **one** API key. The system automatically uses the others as fallback if your primary provider fails. Start with Mistral or Groq.

### Q: What if I don't have composer installed?
**A:** Install Composer from https://getcomposer.org/download/. It's required for PHP dependency management.

### Q: Can I run this on Windows?
**A:** Yes! Use Git Bash, PowerShell, or WSL. All commands work on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Q: Do I need a database?
**A:** Not for basic operation. The app works with file-based caching. Database support is optional for future enhancements.

### Q: Can I run this on pfSense directly?
**A:** Better to run on a separate machine. pfSense has limited resources and this tool needs PHP 8.0+.

## 🔐 Security & Credentials

### Q: Is my firewall password stored securely?
**A:** Yes! Stored in `.env` file which is never committed to git. Keep `.env` file secure and never share it.

### Q: How often should I rotate API keys?
**A:** Monthly is recommended. Update keys in `.env` and restart the application.

### Q: Can I use basic auth instead of API keys?
**A:** Yes! Just set username/password in `.env` instead of API_KEY. The app automatically uses basic auth as fallback.

### Q: Is HTTPS required?
**A:** Optional for local testing, highly recommended for production. The code supports HTTPS.

## 🤖 AI Providers

### Q: Which AI provider is best?
**A:** 
- **Mistral** - Good balance, recommended for beginners
- **Groq** - Fastest inference, best for speed
- **Gemini** - Most capable, good for complex tasks

Try Mistral first, it's excellent and free tier available.

### Q: What if my AI provider goes down?
**A:** The system automatically falls back to the next provider. Configure fallback providers in `.env`.

### Q: Can I use multiple providers simultaneously?
**A:** Yes! One is primary, others are fallback. But you can modify the code to use all three.

### Q: Is there a cost?
**A:** All three offer free tiers:
- Mistral: Free with rate limits
- Groq: Free (very generous)
- Gemini: Free with rate limits

**A:** Use the Logs tab: "Show me failed SSH attempts from today" or send to `/api/logs/search` endpoint.

### Q: Can I analyze historical data?
**A:** Currently analyzes real-time data. Future versions will support historical data with database storage.

### Q: What's the difference between recommendations?
**A:** 
- Security - Fix vulnerabilities
- Performance - Optimize rules
- All - Both security and performance

### Q: How often should I run analysis?
**A:** The dashboard updates in real-time. Run custom analysis as needed or set up cron jobs for regular analysis.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Q: "Connection refused" error?
**A:** 
1. Check PFSENSE_HOST is correct (IP or hostname)
2. Verify pfSense is running
3. Ensure REST API is enabled
4. Check firewall allows port 443

### Q: "API key invalid"?
**A:**
1. Double-check key has no extra spaces
2. Verify key hasn't expired
3. Try different AI provider
4. Check internet connection

### Q: Port 8000 already in use?
**A:** Run on different port:
```bash
php -S localhost:8001 -t public/
```

### Q: Dashboard won't load?
**A:**
1. Check server running: `composer start` active?
2. Open browser console: F12 → Console tab
3. Check application log: `logs/pfsense-ai.log`
4. Enable debug: `APP_DEBUG=true` in `.env`

### Q: Permissions error on logs directory?
**A:**
```bash
chmod 755 logs storage
chmod 644 logs/* storage/*
```

## 📊 Data & Analysis

### Q: Is my firewall data sent to external servers?
**A:** Only firewall API responses are sent to AI providers for analysis. pfSense credentials never leave your system.

### Q: Can I export analysis results?
**A:** Yes! API returns JSON, easily exportable. Future versions will add CSV/PDF export.

### Q: How accurate are threat detections?
**A:** Depends on your firewall logs. The AI learns from patterns in your logs.

### Q: Does it work with OPNsense?
**A:** OPNsense has similar REST API. Should work with minor configuration adjustments.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Q: Can I deploy to cloud?
**A:** Yes! AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or DigitalOcean. Need PHP 8.0+ and internet access for AI APIs.

### Q: How many concurrent users can it handle?
**A:** Single-threaded by default. Can handle hundreds of API requests/minute. Scale with load balancing if needed.

### Q: Do I need Docker?
**A:** Optional but recommended for production. Makes deployment consistent.

### Q: Can I integrate with other tools?
**A:** Yes! REST API makes integration easy. Can call endpoints from Python, JavaScript, etc.
